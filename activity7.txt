Create a JSON object that includes nested objects. Participants can represent a structure with properties like name,age,address,and nested details.
Convert a JSON object created earlier to a string using the JSON.stringify() method.
Assign a task to take the stringified JSON object from the previous step and convert it back to a Javascript object.
Participants should log the resulting object to the console.
